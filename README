### Run program ##
(Assuming Windows OS)
1. Unzip the contents
2. cd to My_Tech_Assignment/tech_challenge
3. Run python idenify_slide.py [followed by the path of the image you want to test] using command line
     for example : python identify_slide.py ../pathology_A_10.png
4. The command prompt will ask user to either enter 1 for classifying using ML or enter 0 for classifying using computer vision methods5. Output will be either A or B
